      <h2>The Myriad Threats</h2>
      <p>
        Hackers lurk. Scammers pounce. Corporations profile. Ex-friends and ex-lovers hold grudges. Governments surveil. The digital stage is busy, and the audience isn’t always friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people walk through this carnival of risks as <strong>heroes</strong>: hearts full, convinced their sincerity protects them. But sincerity alone doesn’t stop data brokers, phishing kits, or legal processes that systematically prey on the trusting, the earnest, and the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter the “zerophile”: a person who leaks zero data except when they <em>want</em> to. They aren't always cynical, and they aren't always paranoid, but their pride in their SecPride is fundamentally unwavering.

      <h2>What is SecPride?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>SecPride</strong> refers to the four pillars of digital sovereignty: <em>Security</em>, <em>Privacy</em>, <em>Deletability</em>, and <em>Deniability</em>. Together, they build a sovereignty posture that most professionals consider out of reach for regular folk. We say otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some, it's a hobby. For others, it's a way of life. SecPride isn’t about hiding in bunkers. It’s about dignity, autonomy, and having fun while you keep your digital skin intact.

      <h2>The Four Pillars of Digital Sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        The four pillars can be illustrated by reference to homeowner sovereignty.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            Prevent unauthorized access to your home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ensure individuals in your home can only access the appropriate rooms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Prevent people peeking in through your windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prevent individuals in one room from hearing conversations in another.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Deletability</h3>
          <p>
            When you throw an item in the bin, you know it's gone for good.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Deniability</h3>
          <p>
            Whether or not any given item is actually in your home remains unclear to anyone but you — even if there's a breach.
          </p>
