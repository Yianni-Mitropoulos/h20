    <h1>Risk Reduction Strategy</h1>
    <p>Hero-to-Zero protects you with humility, rigor, and a bias toward verifiable controls.</p>
    <p>The centerpiece of our posture is how we handle our cryptographic identity. Everything else — infrastructure, processes, recovery — supports that core.</p>

      <h2>Key Management</h2>
      <p>
        Our GPG private key is the beating heart of Hero-to-Zero's trust model. Here's how it's handled:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Air-gapped computer:</strong> permanently stripped of all network hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted key:</strong> the private key is always encrypted, even on the air-gapped system.</li>
        <li><strong>Vault storage:</strong> the system lives in a tamper-detectable, RF-shielded secure vault.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="physical-safeguards">
      <h2>Physical Safeguards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Backups are separated from active signing media.</li>
        <li>Access to the vault requires dual presence; media are serialized.</li>
        <li>No radios, NICs, or wireless modules — zero connectivity by design.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="operational-controls">
      <h2>Operational Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The passphrase is known only to one person — <em>Yianni</em>, our founder.</li>
        <li>The key is only unlocked for short, bounded signing sessions.</li>
        <li>Transfers in and out are done with single-purpose, wiped media.</li>
        <li>Policy changes require out-of-band approval and full documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="residual-risk">
      <h2>Residual Risk</h2>
      <p>
        The one big gap we can't solve yet: <strong>compelled backdoors by court order</strong>.
        A legal mandate could force the introduction of tampered software or processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, our small size makes this an unlikely threat in the medium term. But in the long run, it's a problem that demands a stronger answer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="roadmap">
      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        We're exploring distributed trust models that reduce single points of failure and resist compelled subversion:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Threshold signing (keys split across independent custodians).</li>
        <li>Reproducible builds (verifiable artifacts).</li>
        <li>Transparency logs (auditable signing sessions).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We haven't yet found a design that's both practical and resilient. Please give us time — progress is underway.

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: Why not use an HSM?</strong><br/>
      A: HSMs reduce some risks, but they don't eliminate compelled backdoors and introduce new supply-chain trust issues.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What if Yianni is unavailable?</strong><br/>
      A: We have continuity procedures, but will only detail them alongside the distributed-trust rollout to avoid opening new attack surfaces prematurely.</p>
