      <h2>The Myriad Threats</h2>
      <p>
        Hackers lurk. Scammers pounce. Corporations profile. Ex-friends and ex-lovers hold grudges. Governments surveil. The digital stage is busy, and the audience isn't always friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people navigate this carnival of risks as <strong>Heroes</strong>—hearts full, believing their sincerity protects them. But sincerity alone doesn't stop data brokers, phishing kits, or exploitative legal processes that systematically prey on the trusting, the earnest, and the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter the <strong>Zerophile</strong>: a person who leaks zero data except when they <em>want</em> to. They aren't always cynical, and they aren't always paranoid, but their pride in their SSecPPrideRR is fundamentally unwavering.

      <h2>What is SSecPPrideRR?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>SSecPPrideRR</strong> refers to the eight pillars of digital sovereignty:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Searchability: it's easy to find your own data.</li>
        <li>Security: intrusion is difficult, damage-controlled, and detectable.</li>
        <li>Provability: if you last edited a specific file on a specific day, you can prove that.</li>
        <li>Privacy: you only leak data and metadata that you consent to leaking.</li>
        <li>Deletability: data that seems gone, really is.</li>
        <li>Deniability: you can plausibly deny storing a file that you're storing.</li>
        <li>Reliability: your systems keep working day-after-day, without endless repairs or technical 'fiddling'.</li>
        <li>Recoverability: your data is backed up remotely, and thus recoverable when things go wrong.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, the eight pillars support a level of digital sovereignty that most professionals consider out of reach for regular folk.

      <h2>Why bother with SSecPPrideRR?</h2>
      <p>
        In this brave new world of professional smear campaigns, predatory policing, pervasive mass surveillance, and deepfaked evidence, we believe that access to practical SSecPPrideRR resources is a fundamental human right, and a necessary precondition for human flourishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, sure, not everyone needs the full arsenal presented here. For some this is just a hobby. For others, it's a way of life. SSecPPrideRR isn't about hiding in bunkers. It's about dignity, autonomy, and having fun while you keep your digital skin intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you don't personally need the level of SSecPPrideRR on offer here, this is still something worth showing future generations. Here at Hero to Zero, we believe every kid deserves a fair chance to cultivate their digital sovereignty from an early age, preferably before the smear machine seizes on sensitive information that could be used against them at a later date.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this information protects even one person—from professional hackers, a corrupt corporation, a vindictive ex, or an overzealous officer who has lost sight of their duty—that alone is a victory. Realistically, it will do a lot more than that.
